        <p class="info-p">We have excelled in scattered site acquisitions and operations through hundreds of transactions and thousands of doors under management. Institutional SFR operators have two options for property management: rely on 3rd party management companies or hire internally and incur overhead and variable labor costs in each market. We rely on “1st party management” and incentivized property managers with skin in the game, which allows us to be nimble and location agnostic as we enter new markets.</p>
