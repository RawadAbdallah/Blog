                Our property management partners leverage asymmetric knowledge, that is both market and property

                conservative debt strategies to construct solid assumptions about future performance.

                When buying small portfolios of houses, we inherit a lot of great residents. We also inherit some leases
                that are under-market or under-performing. At each turnover we use equity to reposition assets and
                renovate to achieve market rents.

                Quality housing attracts quality residents, and quality management keeps residents happy and maximizes
                NOI. By partnering with local property managers, we reduce 3rd party client turnover and provide
                investors with stable, predictable cash flows.

        <h1 class="headline">What We’re Best At</h1>
        <p class="info-p">We have excelled in scattered site acquisitions and operations through hundreds of transactions and thousands of doors under management. Institutional SFR operators have two options for property management: rely on 3rd party management companies or hire internally and incur overhead and variable labor costs in each market. We rely on “1st party management” and incentivized property managers with skin in the game, which allows us to be nimble and location agnostic as we enter new markets.</p>
